This is the Myoelectric Personal Training and Control Environment (MPTCE)

=========================================================================



MPTCE is an application that aims to enable people to use surface electromyography (sEMG) data acquisition devices at home for biofeedback training. sEMG signals are processed in order to generate codes for a set of predefined movements by using either threshold-based activation or different pattern recognition algorithms. The generated codes can then be mapped to keyboard events and used to control other programs. 

This software is being developed in collaboration with the Christian Doppler Laboratory for Restoration of Extremity Function and ships with support for a Texas Instruments ADS1298-based USB EMG data acquisition device developed at the Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, both at the Medical University of Vienna (Austria). A playback virtual device for simulation purposes is also included.



DISCLAIMER
==========



This software was initially developed as part of the work conducted by the author to
obtain his Master’s degree. While the code has been reasonably tested, it lacks any medical certification and should be considered experimental. Therefore, the author cannot assume any liabilities derived from using it. USE THIS SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK!



Also, please remember that connecting human beings to machines through electrodes poses the potential risk of electric shock.







REQUIREMENTS
============



MPTCE is delivered as a Visual Studio 2013 solution. In order to compile and run it, you will need:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2013. Known to build on Visual Studio Community 2013 update 4.

- .Net Framework 4.5.2, although it should compile with any 4.x version if you change the solution settings.
 
- HDF5, version 1.8.14 win64 for Visual Studio 2013. Versions 1.8.9 and later should work. You should make sure that your path environment variable points to the directory where the library was installed. The HDF5 library can be downloaded at: 
http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html  

If you want to compile MPTCE as a 32-bit (x86) application, you should download the 32-bit version of the HDF5 library.


- The WinUSB driver. This is required for building the ADS1298 server. It should get installed the first time the ADS1298 device is recognized by Windows. It can be found at:

VISUAL STUDIO SOLUTION CONTENTS
===============================

This solution comprises the following project subdirectories:

* ./MPTCE/: The main program

* ./EMGFramework/: Core libraries of the project. File I/O, pipeline, pipeline stages, pattern recognizers, threshold detection, data providers, etc. Everything else that is not specific to the implementation of the main program or talks directly to the hardware lives here.

* ./ADS1298Server/: Sever program used to retrieve data from the ADS1298 device.

* ./EPDevice/: Code for controlling the ADS1298 device through the WinUSB driver. Used by the ADS1298Server.

* ./ADS1298Intercom/: Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) interface and callbacks for communication between the ADS1298 server and the ADS1298 data provider contained in the EMGFramework project.

* ./QDGraph/: The Quick and Dirty Graph library used to display EMG data.

* ./RecordingPlan/: Implements the control used for presenting the recording schedule while recording data.

* ./MPTCE_installer/: Installer project for MPTCE and the ADS1298 server.

* ./QDGraphTest/, ./RecordingPlanTest/, ./Tester/: Projects containing testing code for QDGraph, RecordingPlan and EMGFramework respectively.



ADDITIONAL CONTENTS
===================

* ./Matlab\ to\ HDF5\ conversion: A Matlab script used to convert memory structures used by BioPatRec TRE to .h5r (HDF5 recording) files compatible with MPTCE.

* ./Image\ resources/: Photographs and clipart used by the program.

* ./icons: Icon files used by MPTCE and the ADS1298Server


++ Check out the recordings branch of the repository for recording samples.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

CHANGELOG
=========




0.2: 



* Corrected GUI behaviour. Removed unnecessary load/save buttons. 


* Automatic rescaling of the amplitude axis of graphs the after a recording is finished 



* Revised images used for guidance during recording. 

* A progress bar is also shown during the warmup time at the beginning of the recording.

* New approach for pattern recognition: only the classes corresponding to desired
  movements are used at the classifier output.

*
 Selecting an activation function for MLP that has minimum or maximum values outside of the range [-1,1] causes the MLP pattern recognizer to automatically select for the output layer a Sigmoidal activation function [0,1] or a TANH activation function [-1,1].

* Revised list of supported activation and normalization functions for each pattern recognition algorithm. 

* New approach for threshold detection: noise amplitude detection is performed before recording starts and used as the lower level for threshold. Threshold maxima are defined by the maximum signal amplitude recorded for each channel.



* New RealtimeConsumer for the generation of keystrokes.

* Saving of a recording is finally possible. The same HDF5-based format as for loading files from BioPatRec is used.

* Created an installer for both MPTCE and the ADS1298 server. The only prerequisite is .NET 4.5.2. .NET will be automatically downloaded and installed if not present.
