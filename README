This is the Myoelectric Personal Training and Control Environment (MPTCE)

—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Version 0.2 (Beta)

=========================================================================

=========================================================================





MPTCE is a software written in C# that aims to enable people to use surface electromyography (SEMG) devices at home for biofeedback training, controlling their computer through myoelectrical signals, or whatever they want to do with it. SEMG signals are processed in order to generate codes form a set of predefined movements by using either threshold-based activation or different pattern recognition algorithms. 

This software is being developed in collaboration with the Christian Doppler Laboratory for Restoration of Extremity Function and ships with support for an Texas Instruments ADS1298-based USB EMG data acquisition device developed at the Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, both at the Medical University of Vienna (Austria).



DISCLAIMER
==========



This software was developed as part of the work conducted by the author to
obtain his Master’s degree. While the code has been reasonably tested, it lacks any medical certification and should be considered experimental. Therefore, the author cannot assume any liabilities derived from using it. USE THIS SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK!



Also, please remember that connecting human beings to machines through electrodes poses the potential risk of electric shock.







REQUIREMENTS
============



MPTCE is delivered to you as a Visual Studio 2013 solution. In order to compile and run it, you will need:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2013

. Known to build on Visual Studio Community 2013 update 4.

- .Net Framework 4.5.2, although it should compile with any 4.x version if you change the solution settings.
 
- HDF5, version 1.8.15 win64 for Visual Studio 2013. You should make sure that your path environment variable points to the directory where the library was installed. You can get the HDF5 library at: 
http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html  



Of course, you can also make use of a 32-bit version of this library, but you must remember to select x86 as the target architecture on all projects in the solution.


- winusb.dll (also comes along with windows driver kit). This is required for building the ADS1298 server.

Or you can run Windows Update under Windows 7 after you plug the device into an USB port on your machine.



VISUAL STUDIO SOLUTION CONTENTS
===============================

This solution comprises the following project subdirectories:

* ./MPTCE/: The main program

* ./EMGFramework/: Core libraries of the project. File I/O, pipeline, pipeline stages, pattern recognizers, threshold detection, data providers, and everything else that is not specific to the implementation of the main program or talks directly with the hardware lives here.

* ./ADS1298Server/: Sever program which is used to retrieve data from the ADS1298 device.

* ./EPDevice/: Low-level code for controlling the ADS1298 device through the WinUSB driver. Used by the ADS1298Server.

* ./ADS1298Intercom/: Interface and callbacks for communication between the ADS1298 server and the ADS1298 data provider contained in the EMGFramework project.

* ./QDGraph/: The Quick and Dirty Graph library. This is used to display EMG data.

* ./RecordingPlan/: Implements the control used for presenting the recording schedule in the recording tab.

* ./MPTCE_installer/: Should create an installer for MPTCE and the ADS1298 server
.

* ./QDGraphTest/, ./RecordingPlanTest/, ./Tester/: Projects containing testing code for QDGraph, RecordingPlan and EMGFramework respectively.



ADDITIONAL CONTENTS
===================

* ./HDF5\ sample\ recordings/: 17 recordings in HDF5 format that were used during software testing

* ./Matlab\ to\ HDF5\ conversion: A handy Matlab script used to convert memory structures used by BioPatRec TRE to .h5r (HDF5 recording) files.

* ./Image\ resources/: Photographs and clipart used by the main program.

* ./icons: Icon files used by MPTCE and the ADS1298Server

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
================

* The code in EPDevice for accessing the ADS1298 device via USB has been provided by the Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, at the Medical University of Vienna (http://www.zmpbmt.meduniwien.ac.at/)

* This software makes use of the Encog Machine Learning Framework by Jeff Heaton for supporting ANN-based pattern recognizers.You can find out more about it at

CHANGELOG
=========




0.2: 



* Corrected GUI behaviour. Removed unnecessary load/save buttons. 


* Automatic rescaling of the amplitude axis of graphs the after a recording is finished 



* Revised images used for guidance during recording. 

* A progress bar is also shown during the warmup time at the beginning of the recording.

* New approach for pattern recognition: only the classes corresponding to desired
  movements are used at the classifier output.

*
 Selecting an activation function for MLP that has minimum or maximum values outside of the range [-1,1] causes the MLP pattern recognizer to automatically select for the output layer a Sigmoidal activation function [0,1] or a TANH activation function [-1,1].

* Revised list of supported activation and normalization functions for each pattern recognition algorithm. 

* New approach for threshold detection: noise amplitude detection is performed before recording starts and used as the lower level for threshold. Threshold maxima are defined by the maximum signal amplitude recorded for each channel.



* New RealtimeConsumer for the generation of keystrokes.

* Saving of a recording is finally possible. The same HDF5-based format as for loading files from BioPatRec is used.

* Created an installer for both MPTCE and the ADS1298 server. The only prerequisite is .NET 4.5.2. .NET will be automatically downloaded and installed if not present.
