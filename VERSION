MPTCE VERSION CHANGELOG
=======================


0.2 (current): 

New features
============

* Corrected GUI behaviour. Removed unnecessary load/save buttons. 

* Automatic rescaling of the amplitude axis of graphs the after a recording is finished 

* Revised images used for guidance during recording. 

* A progress bar is also shown during the warmup time at the beginning of the recording.

* New approach for pattern recognition: only the classes corresponding to desired
  movements are used at the classifier output.

* Selecting an activation function for MLP that has minimum or maximum values outside of the range [-1,1] causes the MLP pattern recognizer to automatically select for the output layer a Sigmoidal activation function [0,1] or a TANH activation function [-1,1].

* Revised list of supported activation and normalization functions for each pattern recognition algorithm. 

* New approach for threshold detection: noise amplitude detection is performed before recording starts and used as the lower level for threshold. Threshold maxima are defined by the maximum signal amplitude recorded for each channel.

* New RealtimeConsumer for the generation of keystrokes.

* Saving of a recording is finally possible. The same HDF5-based format as for loading files from BioPatRec is used.

* Created an installer for both MPTCE and the ADS1298 server. The only prerequisite is .NET 4.5.2. .NET will be automatically downloaded and installed if not present.


Known issues:
=============

* Saving files sometimes fails. Files appear not to close correctly after being written. This apparently causes later errors on opening files.

* A noticeable delay on displaying data happens at the beginning of recording and real-time sessions.

* ADS1298 Server not working on Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 

- 0.1 (unpublished initial release)
